# TAO: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Tracking Any Object

[TAO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10356) is a federated dataset for Tracking Any Object, containing 2,907 high resolution videos, captured in diverse environments, which are half a minute long on average. We adopt a bottom-up approach for discovering a large vocabulary of 833 categories, an order of magnitude more than prior tracking benchmarks.
